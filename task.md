**Backstory**

It's been about 4 years since this was created in September 2019. I was bored and thought, 'Hey, maybe we could clean this up!' üòÅ

So, I've sketched out a few brilliant ideas (well, in my head at least), and these are probably the so-called 'first steps.' Naturally, surprises magically pop up as soon as the real work begins. Let's see if I can pull off this project in a reasonable time frame, or if it's destined to join the ranks of my 600 million other abandoned pet projects. üôà Haha... until maybe another 4 years roll by and I decide to give it another shot?

**Steps:**

Update to TypeScript:
* Install TypeScript and required typings.
* Create a tsconfig.json file.

* Update React Router version.
* Test and update routing components.


Lazy Loading / Code Splitting:
* Identify components for code splitting.
* Implement Suspense for handling loading states.

Replace Loading Spinner with Skeleton Loader:

* Replace loading spinners with skeleton components.
* Customize skeletons to match UI design.
* Test skeleton behavior with different data.

Styled Components or Tailwind?:
* Evaluate familiarity and preferences.
* Install and set up chosen library.
* Update components with styled components or Tailwind classes.
* Refactor styles based on library choice.
